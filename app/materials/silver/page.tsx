              The Timeless Appeal of Silver
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
              Silver has been treasured for its lustrous beauty and workability
              since ancient times. As one of the first metals discovered and
              used by humans, silver has played a significant role in currency,
              tableware, jewelry, and decorative arts throughout history.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
              Its bright white color, high luster, and excellent reflectivity
              make silver uniquely beautiful among metals. While it's more
              abundant in the Earth's crust than gold, silver's beauty and
              versatility have ensured its status as a precious metal.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
              Today, silver remains a popular choice for jewelry, offering an
              elegant aesthetic at a more accessible price point than gold or
              platinum.

            copper, to increase durability. Different standards exist around the
            world to indicate silver purity.
